Our analytics dashboard displays GraphQL subscriptions concurrency, latency, errors, and resolver frequency on dynamic and interactive charts. By signing up for an account through GitHub at [www.aqls.io](https://www.aqls.io) you will receive a user token that is required for setup and allows you to view your app analytics on the dashboard.
